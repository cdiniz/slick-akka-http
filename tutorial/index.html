    <h2>Intro</h2>

    <p>The Slick Akka Http is a very simple json rest api showing one way of using akka http with slick 3 library for database access.
    </p>

    <p> It supports the following features:    </p>

    <ul><li>   Generic Data Access layer, using slick-repo to create generic repositories</li>
        <li>   Cake pattern for DI    </li>
        <li>   Spray-json to parse json    </li>
        <li>   Tests for routes   </li></ul>
    <p>   Utils:    Typesafe config for property management  and Typesafe Scala Logging (LazyLogging)    </p>

    <h2>Running</h2>

    <p>
        The project was thought to be used as a seed for creating akka-http projects with slick, so the implementation is minimal. The model is very simple, is a supplier with a name and description.
</p>  <p>
    The rest api has a get and a post (json), a get for get all the suppliers, and a post to add suppliers. You should view this info in swagger with more detail.
</p>  <p>
    For running the project go to section run, and run it.
</p>  <p>
    For running the project in sbt:

    <pre><code>
    $ sbt
    > run
    </code>
    </pre>


</pre>

    <h2>Slick 3</h2>
    <p>Models as case classes using slick-repo to have generic repos</p>

    <h2>Cake Pattern</h2>
    <p>This seed uses cake pattern to add the possibility to use alternative implementations of some modules, for instance, in tests, the seed uses an alternative implementation for persistence.
    <p>The seed are organized in modules: ActorModule, ConfigurationModule and PersistenceModule. When we are implementing a class/actor that uses some of this dependencies, we just mix them with the modules, or put a parameter that receives the injected modules, for instance:</p>

    <pre><code>
        class RoutesActor(modules: Configuration with PersistenceModule)
    </code></pre>
